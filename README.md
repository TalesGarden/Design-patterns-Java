# Design Patterns with Java
Exploring Design Patterns in Practice with Pure Java


## Implementations
- **Singleton**:This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists, maintaining a global access point to its object.
- **Strategy**: Simplify the variation of algorithms for solving the same problem.categorized as a behavioral pattern of software development. In order to delegate the responsibilities acquired by the entities, thus assigning the behavior.Thus, communication between objects is improved, as there is the distribution of responsibilities. The aim is to represent aoperation to be performed on the elements of an object structure
- **Facade**: Provide an interface that reduces complexity in integrations with subsystems.Makes a complex subsystem easier to use because a simple interface is provided for a set of interfaces in the subsystem. Therefore, dependencies on a subsystem are minimized.
